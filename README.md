# SQL-ANALYSIS-OF-WORLD-INDICATORS-DATA
This project analysed world data for different countries using several indicators such as population, crime index, GDP, etc using SQL to show which countries are leading or lagging in different categories.
This was a final project for the Code First Girls SQL and Data Analysis Course and was awarded the best project of the cohort.
Creating different tables that captured different world facts with Country ID being the primary key, the project analysed the following World Facts and Indicators:
1. Most populated country
2. Least populated country
3. Most dangerous country (using Crime Index)
4. Least dangerous country
5. Richest Country
6. Poorest Country
7. Country with Best Electricity System
8. Country with Worst Electricity System
9. Best Renewable Energy Country
10. Worst Renewable Energy Country

I hope you enjoy the project as much as I did!
